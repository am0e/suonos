Search via album or track?
  album:
	need a composite "search" field for searching:
	ie seach "bach", or search "schiff" should return all albums containing terms bach, schiff, etc.
	"<artists> <composers> <arrangers> <album title>"
  track:
	"artists composers arrangers title"
	Could search for tracks and then get the album id from lucene????

	Problem is track_title is all lower case!!! ?? The lucene suggests module returns the fiend contents
	but these are lower case!
	
Add execAsync() to Request??? - it calls down to vertx. handles exception to set the status code.



JsonObjectWriter.includeRelation()
	Needs to be refactored.
	Problem is:
	myAdaptor(jw, musicAlbum) {
		if (jw.includeRelation("tracks")) {
			jw.genValue("tracks", musicAlbum.tracks());
		}
	}
	It assumes tracks is toplevel.
	What if json response is:
	data: {
		queryResponse: {
			type: "album",
			tracks: {
			}
		}
	}
	The above adaptor code will fail because path is queryResponse.tracks.
